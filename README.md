<h1>Parkinson's Disease Detection using Spiral Drawings</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project aims to develop a deep learning model for detecting Parkinson's Disease based on spiral drawings. It leverages image processing techniques and a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify drawings as either "affected" or "healthy."</p>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>The model is trained on a dataset containing spiral drawings collected from individuals with and without Parkinson's Disease. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training, validation, and testing sets.</p>

<h2>Model Architecture</h2>
<p>The CNN architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers, max pooling layers, and dense layers. It is trained using the Adam optimizer and the Binary Crossentropy loss function.</p>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Precision, Recall, and Binary Accuracy. The results demonstrate high accuracy in classifying spiral drawings, indicating its potential for Parkinson's Disease detection.</p>
